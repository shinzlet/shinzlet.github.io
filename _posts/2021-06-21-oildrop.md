Over the last several months, I developed
[Oildrop](https://github.com/shinzlet/oildrop), a privacy-friendly userscript manager
that only contains around 600 lines of JavaScript. It is intended to be
user-audited in less than half an hour, so that you can be sure it doesn't
collect your data. For context, most other userscript managers contain tens of
thousands of lines of JS.

_Oildrop is lightweight, accessible, and comes with both a light and a dark mode._

The UI was designed by [Chiara Colangelo](https://dribbble.com/ChiaraColangelo),
a freelance graphic designer who did a fantastic job of making Oildrop pop.

_Oildrop can be opened in a window or through its icon, and offers import and
export functionality._

If you're curious why you should care, please continue reading for more context
about why I felt the need to build this extension. If you'd like to install it,
it can be found [here on the Firefox Addon Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/oildrop/).

## Why do Browser Extensions Need so Many Permissions?
Since their inception, browser extensions have been troubled peices of
technology. On one hand, they serve a vital use case, enabling users to make
choices that are otherwise not afforded to them. On the other hand, they often
require extensive permissions which make many privacy conscious users grit their
teeth.

_The permission lists for most popular browser extensions seem overreaching.
Note that these particular extensions are shown only because they're popular,
and not because they've done anything egregious._

Does it make you uncomfortable that Honey, a tool that helps you find coupon
codes, requires permission to "access your data for all websites?" It makes _me_
uncomfortable. However, I don't intend to point fingers, here. It isn't just
Honey doing this. When you understand the technical details a little better,
it's clear that they don't have much of a choice in the matter.

Browsers make developers request permissions for access to certain tools, like
browser history, downloads, or code injection. They don't, however, do this at
a very granular level. In the case of Honey, they don't actually _want_ access
to "your data for all websites" - they just want to display a nice little
widget, and to enter coupon codes in your text field of choice. The problem is
all about granularity. The browser has to disable its privacy safeguards to
allow that, and so it must warn you that "your data for all websites" is at risk.

## Who Should you Trust?
Because even simple browser extensions require such extreme permissions, it can
be hard to know if your data is in good hands. Although most browser extensions
are harmless, there have been many cases of extension makers abusing these
obtuse priveleges to spy on users, and there is no reason to believe that this
will stop any time soon.

One of the most notable examples of this happened after SimilarWeb, an
analytics company, acquired the userstyle manager Stylish. Userstyle and
userscript managers require access to all page and user data as a result of
their internal workings, and [Stylish was caught using these permissions to
silently collect their users' browser history.](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/)

More recently, Avast identified a set of popular browser extensions that
contained [data collecting malware](https://decoded.avast.io/janvojtesek/backdoored-browser-extensions-hid-malicious-traffic-in-analytics-requests/),
which was undetected for years even after approval from various extension
stores.

As a result, answering this section's titular question isn't quite as easy as
it sounds. In my opinion, you should trust a browser extension for one of two
reasons. Either you have significant trust for its author, or you've taken the
time to read its source code yourself. The former option is quite easy, but the
latter method is the only way you can be sure that the extension is safe.

## Oildrop
As a nitpicky software developer, I used to use Stylish and Tampermonkey to
modify my commonly used websites. However, after Stylish had its debacle, I
realized that I had not been paying enough attention to who I was entrusting my
data with.

Additionally, it is very difficult to audit a large browser extension due to
their sizes. [TamperMonkey](https://github.com/tampermonkey/tampermonkey) has
25&nbsp;462 lines of JavaScript,
[GreaseMonkey](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey) has 20&nbsp;784, and 
[ViolentMonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey) has 9&nbsp;539
(measured using csloc).

For most people, that isn't a problem - these extensions are used by many, and
are likely very trustworthy. But for folks trying to be privacy conscious,
that's a big red flag. Nobody can read that much code in a reasonable timeframe.

As a response to this, I developed
[Oildrop](https://github.com/shinzlet/oildrop), which is designed to be
user-audited as quickly as possible. It uses only 565 lines of JavaScript at the
time of writing, and can be easily extended or modified.

To get it that small, I had to make a few sacrifices. It doesn't support the
`GM_` API introduced by GreaseMonkey, and it only works on Firefox at the moment.
However, it doesn't spare any expense on look and feel, and you can be
completely sure that it isn't spying on you.
